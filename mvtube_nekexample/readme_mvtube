This tube has a radius of 0.5, and centerline of x=0,y=0, with z from 0 to 5.0.

this case provide two options for moving boundary projection.

mvtube.usr: the tube geometry discription is hard coded.

mbp_readstl.usr: it read stl files to take geometry information.

the usage of mbp_readstl.usr is  in
